# Multiple-Regression
Here, I am going to use acs_ny.csv dataset for various multiple regression models.
This dataset consists of variables which are not linear and they have a lot of data cleaning mistakes. I am trying to see if I can find those mistakes, and make a better model. So, there might be more than 10 models after I am finished. The R-squared values are around 0.3 which means Multiple Regression is not a good model. However, first I am going to try multiple regression to clean the data and get a sense out of the data and then in the future I will use other regression models.
